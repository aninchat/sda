# sda-port-assignment

This script takes in a .csv file format as an input to automate configuration of interfaces that would otherwise need to be manually configured from a DNAC GUI. An example excel sheet is added here ('sample_host_assignment_sheet.csv') to show the expected format - hostname, interface name, data pool, voice pool, authentication template.
